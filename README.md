# Grover's Algorithm and Quantum Counting Examples

A quantum-based approach to searches that demonstrates a quantum computer's superior speed searching databases, written in Python using the Qiskit library. *Grover's Algorithm*  can obtain quadratic run time improvements for filtering a database by an arbitrary condition, and the *Quantum Counting Algorithm* allows the same benefit for finding the number of solutions that satisfy the condition.

Two examples of Grover's Algorithm and the Quantum Counting Algorithm are included; a basic version that demonstrates the principle of the algorithms and a practical example of the algorithms, which uses them to rapidly solve a binary sudoku puzzle.

Heavily based off of the [Grover's Algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html) and [Quantum Counting Algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-counting.html) examples from the [online Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html).
